# EXERCISE 1:-CALCULATOR USING PYTHON:-
# Operators
# Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmetic operators.

# Arithmetic operators
# Operator	Operator Name	Example
# +	Addition	15+7
# -	Subtraction	15-7
# *	Multiplication	5*7
# **	Exponential	5**3
# /	Division	5/3
# %	Modulus	15%7
# //	Floor Division	15//7

print(5+6)
print(15-6)
print(15*9)
print(16/7)
print(456//67)
print(15%6)  #it's give the remainder.
print(3**5)

#Exercise 1:- Create a calculator capable of performing addition,substraction,multiplication and division 
# operation on two numbers . Your program should format the output in a readable manner.
