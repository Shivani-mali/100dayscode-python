# TYPE CASTING:-
a =3
b =6
print(a+b)
#upper is an integer so it only print !
print("a+b")
#upper all stuff is  string and it's known as a typecasting. 
# Typecasting in python:-
# The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python or type conversion in python.

# Python supports a wide variety of functions or methods like: int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), etc. for the type casting in python.

# Two Types of Typecasting:
# Explicit Conversion (Explicit type casting in python)
# Implicit Conversion (Implicit type casting in python).


# Explicit Conversion (Explicit type casting in python):-
# for eg:-conversion of "STRING" into "INTEGER". by the programmer.
string = "15"
number = 7
string_number = int(string) #throws the error if the string is not valid integer.
sum = number + string_number
print("The sum of the both of the numbers is:",sum) 

# Implicit Conversion (Implicit type casting in python):-
# for e.g:-by the python...
c =32131.54
d =54
print(c +d)
#thta's all about type casting.
