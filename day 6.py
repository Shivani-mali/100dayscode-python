# VARIALES AND DATA TYPES:-
# WHAT IS CALLED VARIABLE:-It is like a container that holds data ,very similar to how tour container in kitchen holds sugar,salt etc Creting a variable is like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning it some value .In Python it's as easy as writing.
#take a container and change the data and store it container...
# variable like a container,how to make it ,example:-
a =1756368957653896358
print(a)
b = "Shivani"
print(b)

# FOR E.G:-
a = 1
b = True
c ="Shivani"
d = None
# they are the four VARIABLES of diffrent DATA TYPES.
# for e.g:-
a =4324
print(a)
a1 = 6756
b = "shivani"
print(b)
print(a + a1)
print("The type of a is ", type(a))

#also some examples are:-
a=1
b=True
c="Shivani"
d=None
a1=98
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(a+a1)
print("The type of a is ", type(a))      
print("The type of b is ", type(b))
print("The type of c is ", type(c))            

# ----------------------------------------------continue..........
#Data Types are mainly,:-1)NUMERIC DATA::-int=23,float=3.5,complex=6+2i.
#2)TEXT DATA:-str...e.g:"hello world".
#3)BOOLEAN DATA:-it contains values of TRUE and FALSE.
#4)SEQUENCED DATA:-List=collection of data , Tuple= it is also collection but they a mutable(NOT CHANGED). 
#5)
