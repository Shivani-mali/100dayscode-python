#Exercise 1:- Create a calculator capable of performing addition,substraction,multiplication and division 
# operation on two numbers . Your program should format the output in a readable manner.

# Make the simple calculator:-

a =45
b =3
print("The value of",a," + ", b, "is:", a+b)
print("The value of",a," % ", b, "is:", a%b)
print("The value of",a," - ", b, "is:", a-b)
print("The value of",a," * ", b, "is:", a*b)
print("The value of",a," / ", b, "is:", a/b)

a =465465367
b =5654
print("The value of",a," + ", b, "is:", a+b)
print("The value of",a," % ", b, "is:", a%b)
print("The value of",a," - ", b, "is:", a-b)
print("The value of",a," * ", b, "is:", a*b)
print("The value of",a," / ", b, "is:", a/b)

# like that you can make the THE SIMPLE CALCULATOR...
